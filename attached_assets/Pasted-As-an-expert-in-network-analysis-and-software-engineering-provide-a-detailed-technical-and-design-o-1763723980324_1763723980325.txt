As an expert in network analysis and software engineering, provide a detailed technical and design overview for implementing a 'Node Correlation' feature on a web application. The core functionality requires users to upload a PCAP (Packet Capture) file, trigger an analysis via a dedicated 'Analyze' button, and subsequently display the correlation between 'entry' and 'exit' network nodes.The output should encompass both visual representations and data-driven insights into this correlation.Specifically, address the following aspects:1.  **Backend Processing**: Describe the architecture for handling PCAP uploads, secure storage, and the processing pipeline. Recommend suitable libraries or tools (e.g., Scapy, TShark, custom parsers) for parsing PCAP files, identifying entry/exit nodes (e.g., based on IP addresses, port numbers, or specific packet flags), and calculating correlation metrics between them (e.g., traffic volume, latency, shared paths, communication patterns).2.  **Frontend Design and Visualization**: Suggest effective methods for visually representing the node correlation. This could include network graphs, flow diagrams, heatmaps, or other interactive visualizations. Explain how to present the underlying raw data correlation (e.g., tables, statistical summaries, log views) in an intuitive and actionable manner. Consider UI/UX elements for the upload process, analysis progress indicators, and interactive filtering/exploration of results.3.  **Key Challenges and Solutions**: Identify potential technical challenges related to performance (large PCAP files), data volume, accuracy of correlation algorithms, and security. Propose high-level solutions or mitigation strategies for these challenges.The response should be structured, practical, and suitable for a development team embarking on this project.",
  "suggested_output": "The output should be a comprehensive, well-structured technical document. It should feature clear headings for 'Backend Processing', 'Frontend Design and Visualization', and 'Key Challenges and Solutions'. Each section should provide specific technical recommendations, mention relevant tools/technologies, explain methodologies for correlation calculation and visualization, and offer practical advice for implementation. The language should be professional and informative, detailing how both visual and data-wise correlation aspects are addressed.",
  "notes": "This optimized prompt transforms the original feature request into a comprehensive technical design query suitable for an LLM like Gemini. The temperature is set to 0.5 to encourage a balanced response that is both informative and slightly creative in its architectural suggestions, avoiding overly generic or repetitive content. Max output tokens are generous to allow for a detailed technical discussion across multiple aspects of the feature. The prompt explicitly asks for both visual and data-wise correlation to ensure complete coverage of the user's original intent."
