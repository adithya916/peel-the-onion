8. Conclusion & Next Steps
This implementation guide provides a comprehensive blueprint for building the "TOR - Unveil" system. The project combines cutting-edge research (DeepCorr CNN models), proven statistical methods (timing correlation), and modern web technologies (Flask + D3.js visualization).

Key Success Factors:

Data Quality: Accurate TOR relay database and clean PCAP captures

Algorithm Selection: Balance between statistical (fast) and ML (accurate) methods

Visualization: Clear, intuitive presentation of complex network paths

Forensic Utility: Actionable intelligence with confidence metrics

Recommended Starting Points:

Begin with statistical correlation (faster implementation)

Use existing tools (Stem, Scapy, Wireshark) as building blocks

Leverage TOR Metrics API for relay data​

Reference open-source implementations (DeepCorr, SUMo)​

This project aligns perfectly with your background in cybersecurity, web development, and ML implementation.
